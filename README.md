# SFDX- Salesforce Developer Experience:

The Salesforce Developer Experience (DX) is a set of tools that streamlines the entire development life cycle. It improves team development and collaboration, facilitates automated testing and continuous integration, and makes the release cycle more efficient and agile.

# What is a Scratch Org?

A scratch org is a dedicated, configurable, and short-term Salesforce environment that you can quickly spin up when starting a new project, a new feature branch, or a feature test.

A Developer Hub (Dev Hub) is the main Salesforce org that you and your team use to create and manage your scratch orgs.
